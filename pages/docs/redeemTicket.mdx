The redeem procces works by under the hood burning the ticket. By burning the ticket your represent that
you are the one that wants the ticket. Think of this like the Checkin proccess before a flight, this burning
of the ticket is you saying yes, I'm physically attending. You can then either use the fact that you burnt the ticket
at the door, or have a secondary proccess where you issue Verificable Credentials to those who have burnt their ticket.
For the bellow Query to work you must replace the ticket ID with a ticket youve created.

import QueryExample from "../../components/QueryExample";

<QueryExample
  query={`query ($ticketId: ID!) {
  node(id: $ticketId) {
    ... on Ticket {
      createRedeemTransaction {
        id
        signerPayload
        expectedSigningAddress {
          address
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  path="data.node.createRedeemTransaction"
  variables={{
    ticketId: "Q0VOTlpuZXRfTmlrYXU6VGlja2V0Ojc2LzEvMQ==",
  }}
  mutation={`mutation ($transactionId: ID!, $signature: String) {
  submitTransaction(transactionId: $transactionId, signature: $signature) {
    status
  }
}`}
/>

The ticket has been succesfully burnt, a Verifiable Credentials could now be created for the customer.
