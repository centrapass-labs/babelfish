Babelfish is a graphQL server, that follows the Relay Specs. Every ID is globally unique, and every object with an ID can be refetched using the Node query.

```graphQL

{
    node(id: "A previously fetched ID") {
        __typename
        ... on TypeIExpect {
            stuff i want.
        }
    }
}

```
